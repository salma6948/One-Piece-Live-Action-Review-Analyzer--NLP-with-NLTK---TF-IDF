My son is a big fan of the comic books and has read every single one. He was very impressed with how they had captured the characters really well, created the world as its imagined in the comics and kept to the original storyline. Very high praise.\\n\\nI didn't know any of the background so enjoyed it for what it is and am really looking forward to the next series.\\n\\nIts not what you would traditionally think of as Anime but its also not Pirates of the Caribbean. Its very much its own thing and does it incredibly well.\\n\\nPlenty of action and nothing for parents to worry about as its very family friendly.\\n\\nI didn't think Netflix could surpass Stranger Things or Wednesday bot somehow they have done it.\",\n          \"What a surprisingly fun show. Having watched only about fifty of the anime episodes, this is a great adaptation. The characters are cast as they are in the anime, which is a breath of fresh air. Not only that, these actors nail their roles. Not only do they look but they play the part. It's a beautiful looking show. The colors and sets are so nice to watch. Some of the earlier episodes seem a bit dark visually though, but it gets better. While it is a fun show, it does leave a few things out, and changes some things, which leaves me from giving it a perfect rating.\\n\\nSomething I wasn't a fan of, was the show skipping some what I feel are important parts of the anime that I feel would've added more depth and emotion. The ship restaurant with Sanji is an example. I also am not of fan of Netflix making Arlong and his pirates be some oppressed group and claiming they are slaves to people. None of this is said or resembled in the anime, and feels something an American show would want to include, and feels very cheap and overused. A small thing I also am not a fan of is not having Sanji with a cigarette in his mouth the majority of the time like in the anime. Apparently this was to give it a more inclusive rating, but that little detail is such a big part of the character.\\n\\nAll in all a fun show I recommend.\",\n          \"This was an incredible journey that followed the straw hat crew. It is easily one of the best shows I have ever had the honor of watching. I was so saddened when I reached the end of the journey, and I really hope for a second season to this wonderful show. The actors were fantastic and were able to portray their characters exceptionally well. The soundtrack really solidified their journey, and the vastness of the world of One Piece. The fight choreography was incredible, and flowed smoothly throughout the show. The ideas and concepts felt natural to the world that the writer had built. I'd love to see season 2.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 40,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"29 September 2023\",\n          \"22 September 2023\",\n          \"5 October 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.268826460747436,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          9.0,\n          5.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This reimagining is absolutely bang on. I love every single actor/actress chosen... and they kept the core details that are really important. It's sped up but REALLY enjoyable and palatable for any new people to the series. The original characters had the super over the top anime personality - but here we get all the charm and good feels well translated into live action. I think people who previously disliked some of the characters would appreciate this much better. Watch it! 10 stars for cast and writing.\",\n          \"I wanted this to be more like Kung Fu Hustle or Hook, but it really didn't feel like the director had a clear vision for the final product. It feels more like a broadway play, with poor direction, cheesy dialogue and over-acting. Like many other manga to live action attempts, it really misses the mark and is riddled with plot holes as they desperately try to squeeze five episodes into one and take zero chances at veering away from the anime in fear of upsetting the fans. The cheesy music and dialogue mixed with violence was confusing, I couldn't tell if this was meant for adults or kids? If something is going to to be sooo unbearably tacky, they should have picked a lane and really ramped up the violence or put more effort into the script. Really stupid and definitely DOES NOT BREAK THE CURSE of all anime live actions being terrible. This one is absolute trash and not the exception.\",\n          \"There has always been an elastic and more tocic relationship between fandom, source material, creators, commercial studios, writers and director. Everyone is pulling and trying to influence as much as possible to have it catered to their needs. But can you blame them? How many (anime/manga) classics have been butchered for the sake of making money. The thing with this show is that the creator is involved and cast grew up with it but also a studio and NF to give that freedom.\\n\\nI hope this shows to all that serializing wins over a movie content crop cgi fest. Also, creative freedom, good writing, staying more true to the source in visuals without having it look like a carnaval but still add some new feel to it makes it worth the adventure.\\n\\nFor once I'm excited for a second season. More budget is needed. I mean the Zoro actor can really swordplay (Rurouni Kenshin) so make that come out. Supporting cast is great but for a potential S2 and the expected roster of Franky, Chopper, Nico Robin and maybe Brook, a bit of an upgrade in overall CGI would do them great.\\n\\nThis may be the missing One Piece in the live action puzzle Hollywood is struggling with.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 40,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"29 September 2023\",\n          \"22 September 2023\",\n          \"5 October 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.268826460747436,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          9.0,\n          5.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Rating_Class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
